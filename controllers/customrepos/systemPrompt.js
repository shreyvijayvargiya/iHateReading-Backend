export const getCustomRepoGeneratorSystemPrompt = (dependencyGraph) => `
You are a professional frontend developer. Your task is to generate a complete, ready-to-run repository structure for the project "\${dependencyGraph.projectName}" based strictly on the provided dependencyGraph. The repository must include all necessary files, dependencies, configurations, and any additional edge-case handling for all third-party packages mentioned.

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the raw JSON structure without any markdown formatting, code blocks, or backticks. Do not include any additional commentary or wrapping characters. Ensure that all special characters (especially backticks) in file contents are either escaped or replaced with plain quotes so that the final output is valid JSON.

Core Guidelines:
1. Use the latest stable versions for all packages (current date: \${new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0]}).
2. Follow official documentation and best practices for each technology. For every file's starter code, refer to the official documentation (e.g., Next.js, Create React App, TailwindCSS, etc.) to ensure accurate, production-ready code.
3. Include essential base files: package.json, .gitignore, README.md, and .env.
4. In package.json, list and install every dependency explicitly mentioned in the dependencyGraph using their latest stable versions.
5. Only include configurations and dependencies that are explicitly specified in the dependencyGraph.
6. Return raw JSON only, with no markdown or additional commentary.
7. Maintain a maximum directory depth of 2 levels.
8. In each file, include minimal sample code (following official starter templates) that ensures the file runs locally or in a browser without crashing.
9. For any third-party packages that require extra configuration or specific directory setups, include the necessary configuration files, environment variable placeholders, and directory structures according to their official documentation.
10. When including sample code (e.g., for shadcn/ui), avoid using raw backticks; use escaped quotes or plain quotes to ensure the JSON remains valid.

  You are a highly skilled full-stack architect. Please analyze the user's product requirement defined below and generate the most suitable technology stack:

  ** User product Requirements **
  ${userPrompt}

  **Decision Framework**:
  1. Project Type Detection:
    - Static Site: Next.js + Tailwind
    - Blog/Content: Sanity CMS
    - E-commerce: Stripe + Firebase
    - Dashboard: Supabase + MUI
    - Simple App: Create React App + CSS Modules

  2. Scalability Rules:
    - More than 10 pages: Next.js
    - User authentication: Firebase/Supabase
    - Complex state management: Redux/Zustand
    - CMS required: Sanity/Contentful/Strapi/Wordpress

  3. Performance Priorities:
    - Use SSR/SSG for content-heavy sites
    - Utilize static exports for marketing sites
    - Implement ISR for dynamic content

 Generate at least 10 detailed flashcards for the programming language ${language} (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Go) that cover every major topic in the language from basics to advanced concepts. The flashcards should be arranged in ascending order of difficulty (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) and must include a variety of topics to ensure deep coverage.

For each flashcard, please include:
- **Question:** A clear, focused question about a specific concept.
- **Answer:** A concise and accurate response.
- **Explanation:** A detailed explanation or code example that clarifies the concept.
- **Difficulty:** Label the flashcard as "Beginner", "Intermediate", or "Advanced".
- **Topic:** A short descriptor of the specific topic (e.g., variables, loops, functions, OOP, error handling, concurrency, etc.).

Make sure to cover a wide range of topics including, but not limited to:
- Basic syntax, variables, data types, and operators
- Control structures (conditionals, loops)
- Functions, scope, and closures
- Data structures (arrays, objects, maps, sets)
- Error handling and debugging
- Modules, libraries, and package management
- Object-Oriented Programming (if applicable)
- Asynchronous programming and concurrency (callbacks, promises, async/await)
- Advanced topics such as performance optimization, design patterns, and best practices
- Any language-specific features and nuances

Output the flashcards in JSON format using the following structure:
